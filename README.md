*Problem description*
- Gathering news from multiple languages, as a bilingual person is a daunting task
- Different sources to view and compare, though not all regions have good news coverage in English
- Missing out the news from the local region, as major global channels do not cover the local happenings

*User wants/needs*
- Gather data from news websites from two different languages and show bullets in English
- Learn and train over time with the user interest based on the field of the news i.e politics, sports, media, etc. and show more relevant news
- All major sources in the regional language should be compared and shown to top 5-10 news.
